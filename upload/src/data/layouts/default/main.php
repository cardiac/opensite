<strong>Introduction &raquo;</strong> Welcome to Primal Fusion! (This site is best viewed with 800x600+ pixel screen resolution.) A site dedicated to the video game and web site community. We\'ve been in action for almost four years now with multiple site layouts and content changes. We\'ve even been through a name change. As time has passed we\'ve seen and experienced so much that we consider ourselves very important to the web community. We thank you for visiting our site at it\'s highest peak yet and hope you enjoy what you see.

<br /><br /><font color=\"navy\">Note to the mod team: I think we\'re getting close to a final build of 0.2. When we\'re ready, we\'ll release the first public build to you guys to do quick installs on your servers. Maybe even upgrades if you want to. If we receive no problems what so ever, we\'ll go fully public. Stay active over the next few days and you\'ll see 0.2 very soon...</font>
