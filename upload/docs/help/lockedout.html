<b><img src="src/images/icons/help.gif"> Help Files - Locked Out?</b><br>
When using the Content Manager, there is always the possibility in which you may get locked out. This could be because you forgot your password or username, or that you mistyped something during your setup. If any of these problems occur to you, immediately contact the site administrator and try to give him as much information as you can about your account. As he cannot give you your password, he can create a new password for you. If there are too many users for him to find out who you are, he may be able to use your e-mail to locate the account. However, if he is still unable to create an account, you will need to create a new account.<p>

If you are the silly administrator who locked himself out of the Content Manager. Contact another administrator and ask him to help you get back in using the above steps. If you are the only administrator, then you will be required to take some extra steps. First of all, if you lost your password, there is NO WAY to recover it as it is set in one way encryption. In order to reset your account information, login to the MySQL server using a MySQL browser. PHPMyAdmin is a good tool for this. Learn your settings information from the table and try to login again. If you lost your password, you can reset it to "admin" by changing it to the following:<p>

That should fully unlock your account. If you have any more trouble, consider, completely reinstalling the Content Manager software.
