1) Introduction
----------------
  Welcome to the one of the first beta releases of openSite. This is a
historical landmark as we are one of the very first public, open source
instances of an excellent and very powerful content management system. We're
very excited about this release and hope that you are as well. In a future
releases we plan to automate many of these processes. Until then, simply just
follow the steps in this file. Before you contact us with any issues you may
have, visit Primal Fusion and view the FAQ before continued use.

  WARNING: THIS IS A BETA RELEASE. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU HAVE A
  PLETHORA OF EXPERIENCE WITH PHP/MYSQL. WE WILL DO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO HELP
  YOU WITH INSTALLATION AND SUCH, BUT WE WILL NOT HELP WITH ANY STUPID
  QUESTIONS. MAINLY, BASIC PHP/MYSQL QUESTIONS.

2) Installation
----------------
 >  NOTE: Please take special note of the words written in all capital letters.
 >  NOTE: %os% is the directory in which you copied openSite over to your
          server.

  1) Extract the .zip, .rar, or .exe archive to a local system directory.

  2) Upload the CONTENTS of the 'upload' folder to the %os% directory in which
     you intend to install openSite.

  3) Go to the %os%/install/index.php file contained within your openSite
     program. This will execute the installation script. Simply follow the
     instructions given by the script to successfully install the program.

  4) Delete the entire %os%/install directory to prevent misuse of your
     openSite installation. You should not use openSite if the script still
     exists.

  5) Modify your site layouts and play with as many settings as you can. If you
     want to test the entire extent of the exciting program, on your main
     index.php file, type the following code:

         <?php include('%os%/src/include.php'); ?>

     Any page actually works, but index.php is required if you actually intend
     to run a site.

  There you have it. That's basically all there is to it to get openSite
running. Go to Primal Fusion's forums if you have any questions with any other
features. This is beta and a more thorough manual is coming. For now, just play
with it. That's the intention.

3) Manual Installation
----------------
  Follow these instructions if you are having trouble with the automatic
installation. These are recommended only for advanced users.

 >  NOTE: %os% is the directory in which you copied openSite over to your
          server.

  1) Extract the .zip, .rar, or .exe archive to a local system directory.

  2) Upload the CONTENTS of the 'upload' folder to the %os% directory in which
     you intend to install openSite.

  3) Modify the %os%/src/data/settings.php file to your database and site
     settings. More instructions are contained within the file. It is
     recommended that you only fill out the database and site settings and
     modify the rest of the settings from within openSite.

  4) Execute the %os%/install/install_table.sql file on your MySQL database in
     order to create all of the tables using your favorite database manager.

  5) Create an the administrator account by executing the following MySQL query
     on your database:

       INSERT INTO `content_users` VALUES (1, 'admin',
         '21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3', 'admin@somewhere.com', '',
         'Administrator', '', 'M', '$site', '$site_url', 0, 0, 'Admins',
         'default', 3, 1);

  6) Delete the entire %os%/install directory to prevent misuse of your
     openSite installation. You should not use openSite if the script still
     exists.

  7) Your installation is complete! Remember to delete the 'install' folder and
     change the administrator password. To login, use the username 'admin' and
     the password 'admin'.

4) Upgrade openSite v0.2 Installation
----------------
  If you have an openSite installation of v0.2.*, you can upgrade to openSite
v0.2.2. Simply follow these instructions to keep all of your data. This should
be a much simpler process than the ContentOne v0.1 upgrade.

  1) Extract the .zip, .rar, or .exe archive to a local system directory.
  
  2) Backup your openSite installation on your server in order to restart the
     upgrade in case you make any mistakes.

  3) Delete all of the files in your installation EXCEPT for the following
     directory: "%os%/src/data/".
     
  4) Upload everything contained in your upload folder EXCEPT the data folder.
     Uploading that data folder WILL OVERWRITE your site information.
  
  5) v0.2.0 ONLY - Now, in order to fix some problems in the openSite data
     directory, you're going to have to make a few modifications to the data
     directory. First, you'll need to delete every ".htaccess" file found in
     the folder EXCEPT the %os%/src/data/.htaccess file. This will not change
     the way openSite functions at all since these files have no bearing on
     your installation. (This includes the .htaccess files found in your layout
     directories.)
     
  6) v0.2.0 ONLY - Upload the src/data/layouts/stylesheets/.htaccess file
     contained within your install package to your site in the proper location.
     This will fix an issue where you were not able to access your stylesheets
     from your main site.
     
  7) Congratulations! Your openSite v0.2.2 software package is all set to use!

5) Upgrade ContentOne v0.1 Installation
----------------
  If you have a ContentOne installation of v0.1.5, you can upgrade to openSite
v0.2. Simply follow these instructions to keep all of your data. It is more
difficult to upgrade to v0.2, but with the api changes in v0.2, the upgrade
process should be much smoother to accomplish in future versions.

 >  NOTE: If you have v0.1.0 to v0.1.2, please upgrade to v0.1.3. If you have
          v0.1.3 or v0.1.4, please upgrade to v0.1.5.
 >  NOTE: %os% is the directory in which you copied openSite over to your
          server.
 >  NOTE: %backup% is referred to the data backup on your system.

  1) Extract the .zip, .rar, or .exe archive to a local system directory.

  2) Backup your ContentOne installation on your server in order to restart the
     upgrade in case you make any mistakes.

  3) Copy all of the files from the %os%/src/data folder and the
     %os%/src/layout/site folder to another location, %backup%, on your server
     or local machine. They will be referred to as %backup%/data and
     %backup%/site respectively.

  4) Delete the entire ContentOne installation from the server (Assuming you've
     followed step 3 fully.) Dont't forget to keep any modules that you want.
     v0.2 has a new skin system, so you're old skins will not work with v0.2.

  5) Delete the entire %os%/install directory to prevent misuse of your
     openSite installation. You should not use openSite if the script still
     exists.

 >  NOTE: The following steps are rather difficult and you will have to pay
          close attention to the wording.

  6) Go to the %os%/src/data folder on your server. Upload the
     %backup%/data/settings.php file over the %os%/src/data/settings.php file on
     the server.

  7) Copy the %backup%/data/404.php and %backup%/data/default.php files to the
     %os%/src/data/layouts/default folder on the server, overwriting the
     versions there.

  8) Copy the contents of the %backup%/data/templates folder to the same
     location, %os%/src/data/layouts/default. DO NOT overwrite the index.html
     or .htaccess files.

  9) Copy the %backup%/site/default.php file (your default layout) to the same
     location, %os%/src/data/layouts/default.

 >  NOTE: Steps 10 through 11 basically repeat steps 7 through 9, but are used
          for different site layouts. You can skip these steps if you do not
          use any other site layout besides the default.

 10) Create a new folder in the %os%/layouts folder entitled by your next site
     layout, %layout%. Repeat steps 7 and 8, except upload it to the new folder
     you created, rather than %os%/src/data/layouts/default.

 11) Copy the %backup%/site/%layout%.php file to the new folder you created.
     Repeate steps 10 and 11 for each successive layout you have remaining.

 12) Upload the contents of the %backup%/site/style folder to the
     %os%/src/data/layouts/stylesheets folder. Do not overwrite the index.html
     file.

 13) Congratulations! You have successfully updated your ContentOne
     installation to openSite v0.2. You may now enjoy all of the new features
     that are contained within this exciting new installment of the openSite
     series!

6) Tools
----------------
  openSite v0.2 now includes tools to help you get the most out of your
installation. Read on for a further description about what each of the tools
do and for installation instructions. The tools may be found in the 'tools'
folder.

  Help File Viewer v1.0.2
  ------------------------------------------------
  The file 'help.php' allows you to access the help file viewer from outside
openSite, as is it's not required to login in order to view all of the help
files. Since all of the information is free to view on the internet, it is not
a security risk to have this installed.

    INSTRUCTIONS
      1) Copy the /tools/help.php file to your main %os% (openSite) directory.
      2) Visit %os%/help.php with any web browser to use.

  Administrative Password Reset Tool v1.0.1
  ------------------------------------------------
  The file 'reset.php' enables you to reset the administrator password to
whatever you want. This allows you to recover access to installations that you
are locked out of. WARNING: HAVING THIS FILE INSTALLED ON YOUR SERVER IS A HUGE
SECURITY RISK. DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER USE.

    INSTRUCTIONS
      1) Copy the /tools/reset.php file to your main %os% (openSite) directory.
      2) Visit %os%/reset.php with any web browser to use.
      3) Delete the file immediately after using it.

7) New Features
----------------
  With this release of openSite there are several key new features:

  1) The site layout system has been redesigned to allow layout specific news
     designs, 404 pages, and default pages. With this new change, openSite is
     now even more powerful and able to build large and extensive sites with
     even more ease.

  2) A new security fix is now in place that basically checks every single bit
     of data that is input into the database. This prevents malicious users
     from causing serious harm to your installation.

  3) Overall aesthetic improvements in many different areas of openSite.

  4) Much more in depth README file to help both new and old users alike.

  5) Finally, ContentOne is officially no more. We are openSite.
